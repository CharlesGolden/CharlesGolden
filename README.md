- 👋 Hi, I’m @CharlesGolden
- 👀 I’m interested in: Learning more about software engineering tools and concepts, and expanding my skill set through autodidacticism (#fancyWords) and projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: OOA/D, UML, JavaScript, data transfer protocols, NoSQL databases, web app development, algorithm design, data pipline design, and more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Any projects, open-source or otherwise, that would be accessible to an entry level software engineer trying to get more experience.
I'm open minded to lots of different subjects and applications! I just want to grow.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me through a repo or my LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/charles-golden-870b55182
